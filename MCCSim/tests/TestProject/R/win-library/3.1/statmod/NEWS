30 May 2014: statmod 1.4.20

- Considerable work on the inverse Gaussian functions dinvgauss(),
  pinvgauss(), qinvgauss() and rinvgauss().  The parameter arguments
  are changed to mean, shape and dispersion instead of mu and lambda.
  The functions now include arguments lower.tail and log.p, meaning
  that right-tailed probabilities can be used and probabilities can
  be specified on the log-scale.  Good numerical precision is
  maintained in these case.  The functions now respect attributes,
  so that a matrix argument for example will produce a matrix result.
  Checking is now done for missing values and invalid parameter
  values on an element-wise basis.  A technical report has been
  written to describe the methodology behind qinvgauss().

- This file has been renamed to NEWS instead of changelog.txt.

- The introductory help page previously called 1.Introduction is now
  named statmod-package.

13 April 2014: statmod 1.4.19

- qinvgauss() now uses a globally convergent Newton iteration, which
  produces accurate values for a greater range of parameter values.

- glmnb.fit() now supports weights.

27 September 2013: statmod 1.4.18

- Update reference for permp().

- bug fix to elda() so that it returns NA for the tests instead of
  giving an error when the Fisher information for the slope isNA.

- Exact roles of authors specified in DESCRIPTION file.

- All usage lines in help files wrapped at 90 characters to ensure
  that code is not truncated in pdf manual.

30 January 2013: statmod 1.4.17

- new function eldaOneGroup() to conduct limiting dilution analysis
  when there is only one treatment group.  This function implements
  a globally convergent Newton iteration to avoid occasional problems
  with lack of convergence of the usual glm calculations.
  
- elda() (aka limdil) now call eldaOneGroup() to get confidence
  intervals and score tests.  This improves the numerical reliability
  of the function. 

- more detail added to the elda() help page about the interpretations
  of the goodness of fit tests.

- new function forward() for forward selection in multiple regression
  with an unlimited number of candidate covariates.

- license upgraded to GPL from LGPL.

28 September 2012: statmod 1.4.16

- gauss.quad() and gauss.quad.prob() now use Fortran to solve
  tridiagonal eigenvalue problem, with considerable gain in speed.
  Updates to references for the same two functions.

- Formatting of gauss.quad test output to ensure agreement between
  Unix and Windows.

- mixedModel2 test code no longer prints REML residuals, because
  these are not reproducible between Windows and Unix.

6 August 2012: statmod 1.4.15

- improvements to glmnb.fit() to make it more numerically robust.

- use of lgamma() in gauss.quad() to avoid floating overflows
  with kind="jacobi".

19 November 2011: statmod 1.4.14

- power.fisher.test() now accepts a new argument alternative
  which indicates the rejection region.

25 October 2011: statmod 1.4.13

- bug fix to glmnb.fit() when dispersion is a vector argument.

18 October 2011: statmod 1.4.12

- glmnb.fit() now accepts vector dispersion argument.

- change to residual returned by tweedie glms when var.power=2
  and y==0.  In this case the theoretical residual is -Inf.
  The value returned by the tweedie family is finite, but smaller
  than previous.

  iterations used.

18 February 2010: statmod 1.4.3

- new function permp() which calculates exact p-values for
  permutation tests when permutations are sampled with replacement.

5 January 2010: statmod 1.4.2

  user to set a known value for the dispersion parameter.
