# MCC Modeling and Simulation 

Welcome to MCC Modeling and Simulation project.

Due to a lack of models and simulation tools to study and analyze mobile devices resource limitation using cloud computing as a solution, this project consists in modeling and simulation of an MCC architecture in which we focus on offloading decision (static and dynamic approach). The static approach only marks a given Task to be offloaded while the dynamic one works considering the tradeoffs between computation and communication [1].
